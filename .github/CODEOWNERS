# This is a CODEOWNERS file that defines individuals or teams responsible for code in this repository
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo
# *       @username

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes precedence
# Example: Backend code owned by backend team
# /backend/  @org/backend-team

# Example: Config files owned by platform team
# *.config   @org/platform-team

# Example: Documentation owned by docs team
# /docs/     @org/docs-team

# Example: CI/CD workflow files owned by DevOps
